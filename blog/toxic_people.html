<p>You have the right to limit your interactions with toxic people as you see fit. You have this right no matter what your relationship to the toxic person is, or how long you have tolerated, or may even have enabled, that person.</p>

<p>Toxic people will try to use your relationship with them to guilt you ("but we've been friends for so long"). It's a ruse. If they valued the relationship, they would have treated you better. Toxic people thrive when others feel obligated to put up with them. They are counting on you to compromise so they can get their way. </p>

<p>Yes, you have the right to limit your interactions with toxic people even if it upsets them. You are not responsible for managing anyone's emotions but your own. Yes, even if they have apologized for their toxic behavior in the past, but continue the pattern of toxic behavior. Some people believe they can get off the hook for anything by saying "sorry" afterwards (I have actually heard this excuse from one such person). Apologies are only meaningful when they are contrite and are followed by the apologizer making a change to address the problematic behavior. You don't have to accept an apology that is an apology in name only. </p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with taking care of yourself. It will be hard at first, but don't feel guilty about doing what's right for you. You will be a better and healthier person for it. </p>
