	<p>Sometimes I think back to the fist time someone genuinely complimented my academic writing, not just because it was kind, but because I was confused. I had so normalized negative feedback that I couldn't interpret what was said in the moment as a compliment.</p>

	<p>Prior to that, the feedback I received on my writing ran the gamut from unconstructive to straight-up unkind, sometimes with a dash of patronizing for flavor (I guess). And a lot of the feedback was designed to control my voice as a writer, not to improve content or clarity.</p>

	<p>Part of my confusion about the compliment was that another person who read the same document came back to me with only negative feedback. I later learned that some academics don't know how to give constructive criticism, either they never learned or can't be arsed to do it.</p>

	<p>You know the reviews that are deeply upsetting? The ones that make you think, "wow, they couldn't think of a single positive thing to say about the work?" and "ok, but did they have to be so rude about it?" I guarantee those reviewers do the same to their students, if not worse.</p>

	<p>Which brings me to the unsolicited advice portion of the post. 

	<ol>
		<li>Always start your critique with something positive. The work might be flawed, or misguided, but someone spent a lot of time and effort to create it. Recognize the hard work. Convey that you see its value.</li><br />
		<li>Don't use all caps in your feedback, not even for emphasis. This might seem small, but it can have a big effect on the reader. It's hard to read feedback as constructive if it reads as though the writer IS YELLING IT AT YOU. If you want to emphasize a point, use words to do so, e.g., "Before I can recommend the paper for acceptance, the authors must address the following:" or "A key issue I would like to see addressed is", etc.</li><br />
		<li>When giving students feedback, please don't police their voice as a writer. Your phrasing preferences are just that: preferences, not objective writing guidelines. Address content and clarity issues and let their individuality shine through.</li><br />
		<li>Minimize emotional language. Maybe something in the work shocked, angered, or disappointed you, but chances are the author wasn't trying to upset you personally, and using emotional language it is not helpful. You can critique the same points without the drama.</li><br />
		<li>Take some time away from the feedback before you send it. Sleep on it, if you have enough time. Then reread your feedback. Think about how you would feel if you received that feedback on your hard work. If you are bad at that, run it by someone else. Edit for tone as needed.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

	<p>Why should you bother with the above advice? Because it matters. I was anxious about submitting work for years because of the awful feedback I received. Only recently, now that I have received more positive and constructive feedback, has that started to change.</p>
